# Activities UI (SpeedTyping v1)

In-Chat “Play” action opens a modal to start SpeedTyping between two users in a 1:1 chat thread. 
UI constraints: minimal cognitive load, real-time feedback, micro dopamine toasts.

## Surfaces
- Choose Activity Modal (single card: SpeedTyping)
- Live Session View (timer, text to type, input, live WPM/accuracy, mini-scoreboard)
- Summary View (winner, deltas, “Rematch”)
