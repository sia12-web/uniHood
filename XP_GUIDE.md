## Anti-Cheat / Diminishing Returns

To prevent spamming and abuse, "diminishing returns" apply to repetitive actions with the same user within a 24-hour period:

1.  **1st Interaction**: 100% XP
2.  **2nd Interaction**: 50% XP
3.  **3rd+ Interaction**: 0% XP

*Note: Interactions with unverified users may yield reduced XP (50%).*
